# Smart Application for Accident Detection (SAAD Application )
> We develop an accident detection system ( SAAD ) that helps save victims on time and reduces the risk of death from road accidents. The system ( SAAD ) will send an immediate alert to the saudi red crescent and traffic accident police team the scene to inform them of the incident so they can take immediate action. The application( SAAD ) will help to determine the exact location, as well as the patient’s condition, health, and personal data.

## Scope of the Application
In light of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s orientation to build a digital society during Vision 2030, we will create an application ( SAAD ) to report accidents immediately when they occur using IOT technologies without the need for external intervention. This application ( SAAD ) helps speed up the arrival of ambulances to the exact location of the accident and the ability to save the injured in great proportion and  and advantage of the modern technology.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Android Studio
* Firebase
* Arduino IDE 1.8.16
* Crash sensors
* Gyro Sensors



## Driver Interfaces
* Start Interface: The first interface will appear to the user when the application is opened it will determine whether it is a driver or belongs to the relevant authorities (police or ambulance).
When the driver option is selected, the application will display a dialog box containing the terms and conditions of our application, when the driver clicks ”Yes I AGREE!” The page to enter the application will be displayed.When he has a preexisting account, he must enter the email and password and then click “LOGIN”, and when he does not have an account, he must click “Sign up now”.
