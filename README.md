## Scope of the Application
In light of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s orientation to build a digital society during Vision 2030, we will create an application ( SAAD ) to report accidents immediately when they occur using IOT technologies without the need for external intervention. This application ( SAAD ) helps speed up the arrival of ambulances to the exact location of the accident and the ability to save the injured in great proportion and  and advantage of the modern technology.


## Proposed solution
We propose an accident detection system ( SAAD ) that helps save victims on time and reduces the risk of death from road accidents. The system ( SAAD ) will send an immediate alert to the saudi red crescent and traffic accident police team the scene to inform them of the incident so they can take immediate action. The application( SAAD ) will help to determine the exact location, as well as the patient’s condition, health, and personal data.
